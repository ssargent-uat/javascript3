Files created and added per assignment Assignment 1.1: The Foundation 

    Demonstrate basic formal problem-solving techniques for programming.
    Describe and apply variables, basic and composite data types, and collections.
    Develop basic and common algorithms using the elements of structured programming.
    Demonstrate effective troubleshooting, testing, and debugging, of programs. 
In this course, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learn the basics of programming. For this assignment, we will create 2 webpages. We will add more code to these pages as the class progresses. 

Files that we will create in this assignment:

    index.html
    boards.html

Objectives

    Understand and code 2 working HTML pages.
    Understand technical requirements
    Translate technical requirements into 2 HTML pages.
    Code HTML 5.0 tags

Requirements

Code each of the following tags below to create an index.html page:

    Doctype
    HTML open/close tags
    Head open/close tags
    Title open/close tags
    Title text
    Body open/close tags
    Header open/close tags (hint, h1)
    Header text (i.e., page title)
    Paragraph open/close tags
    Add a fun (school-appropriate) meme to the page. 
        Download the image file (.jpg, .png, .gif, or .webp)
        Save the image to the same folder where the index.html is located
        Include the image in the index.html page using an img tag and place it in between the opening and closing paragraph tags, like so:

<p>

    <img id="memeImage" src="replace_with_the_file_name_and_extension_of_the_image">

</p>

    Once you have created the index.html, create another .html page called boards.html
    Copy and paste all of the code from index.html to boards.html
    Change the title text and the header text
    Remove the meme image (delete the whole <img ... > tag)
    Copy and paste the program objectives for your major into the boards.html page. 
    The program objectives can be found in the University Catalog: UAT Catalogs
    Create a nice look and feel for the user.
    Comment above almost every line of your code
        Comment syntax: <!-- This is an HTML comment -->
    Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.

Deliverables

    Submit a print screen of your application running.
    Submit a link to your GitHub repo (see below if you have not set this up yet). 

GitHub (https://github.com/ (Links to an external site.)) is used as a software repository (repo for short). It is a place to store and distribute code for teams of people developing the software. 

For coding assignments, you can:

    create a specific repo for the assignment
    make the repo public
    submit the location of that repo as the submission for the assignment
