    <p><h2>ROBOTICS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS</h2></p><br>
        Robots and connected embedded digital systems provide smart solutions that extend human capabilities. Powered by<br>
        artificial intelligence and data generated in real-time by nature, people and the systems that exist within robots and drones,<br>
        the degrees of autonomy surrounding us increase as they perform valued tasks. UATâ€™s Robotics and Embedded Systems<br>
        (RES) degree provides students with the foundation for the design, implementation and analysis of embedded systems that<br>
        make robots, drones and other platforms viable tools. A degree in RES incorporates mechanical design, digital logic design,<br>
        embedded programming, machine vision, sensing, big data and artificial intelligence into the development and design of<br>
        robotic systems that solve useful problems. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Robotics and<br>
        Embedded Systems is 15.040</p>
